As a big fan of King's Hawaiian\u00ae bread (and rolls), I tried all kinds of online recipes but did not find one that was close enough to the original. While King's does not use a roux (nor pineapple juice), if you want fluffy, pillowy texture that keeps for a few days, this technique is key! All my friends go nuts over this bread.\"        ",
