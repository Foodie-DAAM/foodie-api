Add more lemon juice for runnier icing. Divide icing into small bowls and color with red food coloring in different shades of red or pink, keeping a portion of the icing white. Cover with a damp kitchen towel at all times so it won't dry out.",
      "Step 7 Decorate as you like using different techniques. For the flood technique, use runny royal icing in a piping bag with a small round #2 tip and pipe a line around the edge of the cookies. Fill in the center, evenly distributing the icing with a scriber tool.",
      "Step 8 For hearts, add dots of a different color onto the wet icing and drag the scriber tool downwards through the dots. For lips, add an oval shape onto the wet icing and shape the oval into lips with the scriber tool.",
      "Step 9 For feathers or patterns, pipe a line around the edge, then add stripes in different colors. Drag the scriber tool down through the stripes. For a marbled effect, pipe lines of different colors across a base layer, then drag the scriber tool up and down through the lines. Allow the icing to set completely."

Tent chips with more foil, then place baking sheet back in oven. Bake until cheese is melted and wings are browned and crispy in spots, 5 to 8 minutes.",

Scatter red onion, tomatoes, jalapenos, and cilantro over nachos. Place a dollop of sour cream over each smashed potato, then top with bacon and chives. Season with more salt and pepper and serve."

Sprinkle about half of the nuts and remaining marshmallows over the caramel. Go easy on the marshmallows though, or the top won't sit well on the cake.",

      "Place the bananas, 1/3 cup chocolate chips, clove, cinnamon, and vanilla into a mixing bowl, and mash until evenly blended. Alternatively, chop the mixture in a food processor until the chocolate chips have been reduced in size. This will help prevent the chips from poking through the wonton skins as you handle them. It will also change the texture of the filling - you will not have pockets of melted chocolate in the wontons.",
      "To make the wontons: Separate and place the wonton wrappers onto your work surface. Spoon about 1 teaspoon of the banana filling onto the center of each wrapper. Use your finger or a pastry brush to lightly moisten the edges of the wonton wrappers with water. Fold one corner of the wrapper over the filling onto the opposite corner to form a triangle. Press the edges together to seal. Repeat with the remaining ingredients.",
      "Prepare the sauce by combining the butter, brown sugar, orange liqueur, and corn syrup in a small saucepan. Bring to a simmer over medium heat, and cook until the sugar has dissolved and the sauce is smooth, about 4 minutes. Set aside to cool slightly.",
      "Fry the wontons in the hot oil a few at a time until golden brown, about 4 minutes. Turn the wontons over halfway through cooking so they brown evenly. Remove, and drain on a paper towel-lined plate. Serve warm with the caramel sauce. Sprinkle with the remaining 2 tablespoons chocolate chips to garnish.",

Layer more eggplant and plates until all of the eggplant is sandwiched. Cap it off with one additional plate, and press down firmly. Set a sturdy stock pot on top, and fill with enough water to create some pressure on the eggplant layers. Not so much pressure that you break your dishes though. Let this pressing process stand overnight.",

One layer (handful) at a time, briefly swish the eggplant around in the ice water, then squeeze dry and place into a clean bowl. If your hand starts to hurt, you are swishing too long. Once all of the eggplant is rinsed and squeezed and in the bowl, mix in the vinegar. Let rest for about 15 minutes.",

    "description": "\r\n\"This has been popular in my family for decades. The old way my father made it was to grind the cheese in a meat grinder, then beat the mixture in the electric mixer, which was time consuming. I've experimented and developed a quicker way to make it with a food processor. Just make sure you have one with a strong motor. The spread keeps for at least a couple of weeks in the fridge. Before serving, it is better to let it come to room temperature. Serve with crackers as an appetizer. Can be warmed in the microwave for Welsh rarebit as well.\"        ",

The spread will firm up when chilled; if too stiff, mix in more beer, a teaspoon at a time, to desired consistency.",
