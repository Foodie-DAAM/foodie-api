Adding these spices to the beef brings out a lot of Greek-style flavors which complements the feta perfectly, and if you have any left over, you can easily add a bit more tomato sauce and veg to it the next day for a quick chili. Serve immediately on its own or with a side salad. Bon appetit!\"        ",
