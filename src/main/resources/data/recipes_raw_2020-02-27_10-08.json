Add milk, vegetable oil, eggs, and 2 teaspoons vanilla extract to flour mixture and mix together using an electric mixer on medium speed until well combined. Reduce speed and carefully pour boiling water into cake batter. Beat on high speed for about 1 minute to add air to the batter. Distribute cake batter evenly between the prepared cake pans.",

Add chocolate-hazelnut spread and increase the speed to medium. Beat for 2 minutes. Add 1 teaspoon vanilla extract and kosher salt and whip for an additional 30 seconds. Add 2 tablespoons heavy whipping cream and beat until the frosting lightens slightly in color and texture, about 1 more minute.",

Whisk together 1/4 cup cream and 1/2 tablespoon shortening in a small saucepan and bring to a boil over medium heat. Pour boiling cream mixture over chocolate and whisk until melted and smooth. Let cool slightly, then pour mixture into a clean squeeze bottle. Let set until it has the consistency of thin ranch dressing. Squeeze on top of the frosted cake and allow to drip down the sides. Chill until chocolate is set. Decorate the top of the cake with assorted confections of your choice and serve at room temperature."
