But since many of my viewers don't live near such stores, I decided to take one for the team and show you how to make your own. Is it worth all the effort? Well, fried cheese curds are a very nice treat, and having a cube of fresh cheese to pop into your mouth any time you get the urge is pretty sweet. And, of course, your poutine will thank you. You can serve these immediately or cover with a cheesecloth and let sit for 12 hours for a tangier flavor.\"        ",

    "description": "Similar to the more well known version made with chicken livers, but I've made some additions. This came about when a co-worker gave me about a dozen duck breasts and I had to find a way to use them up. The result was an appetizer that continues to be a favorite at dinner parties, and one that can be prepared well in advance of actual cooking.\n\n If you are like some people who don't care for the gamey flavor of wild duck, I'm including a technique to soften or tame it. This can be made the day before your party and kept tightly covered in the fridge. Bring to room temperature before the final grilling. ",

      "Step 3 Lay bacon slices on a work surface. Place 2 spinach leaves, 1 cube of duck, and 1 water chestnut at 1 end of each slice, rolling it up and securing the ends of the rumaki with a toothpick. Sprinkle thyme on top.",

      "Step 5 Grill the rumaki until brown and crisp, turning occasionally, about 8 minutes.",

As a big fan of King's Hawaiian\u00ae bread (and rolls), I tried all kinds of online recipes but did not find one that was close enough to the original. While King's does not use a roux (nor pineapple juice), if you want fluffy, pillowy texture that keeps for a few days, this technique is key! All my friends go nuts over this bread.\"        ",

Traditionally, the broth takes hours, or up to an entire day to make. But with an Instant Pot\u00ae, that time drops. This recipe makes a creamy pork broth that serves as the perfect base to your tonkotsu ramen dish. Flavor the broth however you'd like, but this recipe suggests using soy sauce, miso, and a Japanese fish bouillon (in granules) called \"dashi.\" ",

      "Step 2 Turn on a multi-functional pressure cooker (such as Instant Pot\u00ae) and select Saute function. Warm the olive oil in the pot. Add leeks, onion, and garlic. Saute until onion is clear and has begun to brown, 7 to 10 minutes. Turn Saute mode off.",
      "Step 3 Place the cleaned pork bones into the inner pot on top of the onion mixture. Add 4 cups of water. Place the lid onto the Instant Pot\u00ae, with the vent set to Sealing.

      "Step 6 Season strained broth with salt and pepper. Add in dashi and remaining 1 cup water. Stir in soy sauce. Bring broth to a slow boil over medium-low heat; turn heat down to a simmer. Scoop out 1/3 cup of the broth into a bowl. Add the miso into the bowl and \"soften\" the miso with a spoon, dissolving it into the broth. Return this paste to the saucepan. Mix paste into the broth and combine well. Add spinach to the broth. Continue simmering for 10 minutes (do not bring to a boil).",
