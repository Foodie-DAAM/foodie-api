After grating (always scraped a knuckle or two), we'd place the mushy potato into a towel and twist it until all the juice was gone. Ouch! Sometimes the towel would rip, shooting the mix everywhere.

Roll the crust out between two sheets of waxed paper and transfer it to a 9-inch pie pan. Trim or crimp the edges. Prick the bottom and sides of the crust with a fork and sprinkle with chopped pecans.",

Heat the mixture over high heat until the mixture boils. Reduce the heat and simmer until the filling is thick and clear, 8 to 10 minutes. Gradually whisk a portion of the hot filling into the beaten egg yolks. Return the yolk mixture to the saucepan and cook for 1 minute more, stirring constantly.",

Gently run the spatula through the center of the bowl, then around the sides of the bowl, repeating until fully incorporated. Add the remaining meringue, folding just until incorporated. Allow the mixture to cool for 25 minutes; the filling should mound from a spoon when dropped back into the bowl.",
