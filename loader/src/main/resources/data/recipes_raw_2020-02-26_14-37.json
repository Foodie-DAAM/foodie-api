    "title": "Mango-Habanero Chicken Wings",
    "description": "Being a big fan of restaurant-style mango-habanero wings, I set out to create something similar. I found multiple recipes online, but none seemed up to my standards. After about a year of making a few and combining different ideas, I came up with this one. Every time I've made this, it's been a huge hit and people are always asking me for the recipe, so here it is. The cornstarch absorbs extra moisture and forms a very thin crispy crust on the wings. It's not a heavy breading, it just adds a bit of crunch. ",
    "ingredients": [
      "30 chicken wing sections",
      "1 (12 ounce) can mango nectar",
      "\u00bc cup brown sugar",
      "6 habanero peppers, stemmed",
      "2 tablespoons soy sauce",
      "1 tablespoon sriracha hot chili sauce",
      "1 tablespoon rice vinegar",
      "1 stick butter",
      "3 cloves garlic, minced",
      "2 tablespoons honey",
      "1 cup cornstarch",
      "2 cups vegetable oil for frying"

      "Step 1 Rinse chicken wings and pat dry with paper towels. Place wings on a baking sheet and refrigerate to dry a bit more. Advertisement",
      "Step 2 Combine mango nectar, brown sugar, habanero peppers, soy sauce, sriracha sauce, and vinegar in a food processor. Mix until peppers are pureed; seeds will still be visible. Remove food processor lid carefully; the pepper fumes can be strong.",
      "Step 3 Melt butter in a saucepan over medium heat. Add minced garlic; cook until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Add the mango-habanero mixture immediately; bring to a simmer, stirring frequently. Reduce heat to medium-low; add honey. Simmer, stirring frequently, until sauce is reduced by 75% and thickened to a glaze, 45 minutes to 1 hour. Remove from heat.",
      "Step 4 Preheat the oven to 200 degrees F (95 degrees C).",
      "Step 5 Heat oil in a deep-fryer to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).",
      "Step 6 Coat wings lightly with cornstarch. Place 5 to 6 wings in the hot oil; fry until golden brown and crispy, about 8 minutes. Place wings on a paper towel to absorb excess oil; transfer to the preheated oven to keep warm. Repeat until all wings have been fried and drained.",
      "Step 7 Place wings in a large bowl. Pour half the sauce over the wings and mix, coating the wings with the sauce. Continue adding the remaining sauce until you have coated the wings to your liking."

Sprinkle 1 tablespoon of Cajun seasoning into the cuts and onto the meat, then replace the skin. Whisk 1/2 cup olive oil and white wine together in a bowl. Place the chicken into a large bowl, pour the olive oil mixture over, stir to coat, and refrigerate 1 hour. Advertisement",

Heat 1/4 cup olive oil in a large skillet until the oil shimmers, and brown the chicken pieces over medium heat, working in batches if necessary, about 5 minutes per side. Place all the chicken pieces into a large soup pot, and pour the broth over the chicken. Bring the mixture to a boil, reduce heat to a simmer, and cook the chicken until tender, about 20 minutes.",

Return the chicken meat to the soup. Simmer 15 more minutes, and skim off the layer of oil that has formed on top of the gumbo.",

    "description": "This is an authentic familiar traditional Cantonese home-style dish.  It's a recipe mostly passed on within families, and it is rare to find this dish in any Asian restaurant.  Trust me though, it is VERY good.  It's actually intentionally salty tasting, so it goes very well with white rice. Salty eggs are also called a Haam Daan- you can find them at all Asian supermarkets. ",

The milk will make the texture smoother. Let stand for 15 minutes to marinate. In Chinese cooking, this is the best time to prepare the rest of the dishes for the meal and begin cooking rice.",
      "Step 3 Take the pieces of salted egg yolk and push them into the pork. Smooth the top of the pork until it is flat and even. Arrange broccoli florets around the outer edge of the meat.",
      "Step 4 Place the bowl in a steamer or in a large pot with a couple inches of water in it. Set over medium-low heat. Steam until the meat is browned throughout, about 30 minutes. Serve with rice. The yolk is the most coveted part of the dish. Ration it carefully! It is very salty, so it is best to eat the yolk a tid bit at a time with a larger bite of meat, mixed with a mouthful of rice."

I sprinkle the trunk of the tree with crisp bacon and the tree itself with finely chopped green onion tops or chives. I have also shaped it into a cross for my children's confirmation parties, a Christmas stocking, and even a heart for a special Valentine's Day party. If you substitute creamy salad dressing for the mayonnaise it will not be the same. My mom tried that and it didn't turn out well. This is best made the day before and chilled. My family and friends all love this; it's one of those dishes that I have to make for every holiday and get-together. ",

Add the sherry and chicken stock; bring the mixture to a gentle boil, reduce heat to medium-low, and simmer for 45 minutes. Remove from heat and allow to cool at least 30 minutes.",
      "Step 3 Pour the soup into a blender, filling the pitcher no more than halfway. Hold the lid in place with a folded kitchen towel and carefully start the blender, using a few quick pulses to get the soup moving before leaving it on to puree. Return the blended soup to the stockpot; stir in the reserved asparagus tips and the heavy cream. Cook over medium heat until soup is hot and the asparagus tips are heated through but still crunchy, about 3 minutes. Season with salt and pepper."

Saute, continually breaking up the pieces, until they are all golden brown. Transfer to the sauce. Brown the meatballs, chopped sausage links, and pork bones on all sides until they are a deep golden brown. You may need to do this in stages, and continually transfer into the sauce when browned.

Frequently stir, and season with salt and pepper to taste for about another hour after the last meat has been transferred into the pan. Finish by stirring the remaining fresh parsley into the sauce. Spoon sauce over your favorite pasta and serve the meat on a separate plate."
