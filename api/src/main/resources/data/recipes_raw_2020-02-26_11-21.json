I generally use brown rice flour, but white rice flour may yield a fluffier muffin. I personally like the texture the cornmeal adds, but for a more traditional muffin, feel free to do all rice flour (maybe half brown, half white).\"        ",

Perfect for fall-winter comfort-style dinners. Pairs well with traditional mashed potatoes and dinner rolls.

Cardamom adds an unusual and subtle perfume to these preserves.  Though this recipe does take some time to complete, the majority of the cooking time is hands-off.  The best part?  You will not need to purchase pectin from the store! Adjust the sugar content to your liking, erring on the side of less sweet, as the jam will cook down considerably. ",

Allow the plums to cool. Advertisement",

      "Step 3 Put the plums back into the original pot with the sugar and butter. Cook at a very low simmer until the mixture begins to thicken, about 4 hours. To test for adequate development of pectin, drop a spoonful of the jam on a plate and put it in the refrigerator for a few minutes: the mixture should be soft-set and no longer syrupy.",
      "Step 4 Ladle the hot jam into hot, sterile jars, wipe the rims clean, place sterile lids on, and tighten the screw caps. Allow the jars to cool to room temperature and check to be sure that each jar has sealed."

    "description": "\r\n\"This recipe was given to me by a dear friend.  It's perfect for a special occasion, and is as good as you'll get from any restaurant.  The filets are topped with a mixture of liver pate (pate de foie gras) and mushrooms and wrapped with puff pastry and served with a red wine sauce!\"        ",
    "ingredients": [
      "2 tablespoons vegetable oil",
      "salt and pepper to taste",
      "6 (6 ounce) beef tenderloin filets",
      "1 cup chopped fresh mushrooms",
      "1/4 cup red wine",
      "1 cup beef consomme",
      "1 (3 ounce) jar foie gras pate",
      "1 (17.25 ounce) package frozen puff pastry, thawed",
      "1 egg, beaten",
      "3 tablespoons butter",
      "3 tablespoons all-purpose flour",
      "2 tablespoons chopped green onion",
      "1 cup beef consomme",
      "1/2 cup red wine",
      "2 tablespoons butter",
      "2 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley"
    ],
    "instructions": [
      "Heat the oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Season the filets with salt and pepper, then fry on each side until browned to lock in the juices. Remove from the skillet and set aside to cool slightly.",
      "Add the mushrooms, wine and beef consomme to the skillet; cook and stir over medium heat until mushrooms are tender. Use a slotted spoon to transfer the mushrooms to a small bowl, reserving the consomme. Mix the pate with the mushrooms, adding a little consomme if needed to achieve a spreadable texture. Divide the mushrooms among the filets and spread on the top. Refrigerate about 30 minutes.",
      "Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Lay the puff pastry out on a clean surface and cut out two 5 to 6 inch rounds for each steak. You can roll it out a little thinner if you need more area. Place a steak onto a round, and bring the edges up around the sides. Cover the top with a second piece of dough, overlapping the edges and pressing to seal into a package. Repeat with remaining steaks. Place the Wellingtons onto a baking sheet, and brush the tops with beaten egg.",
      "Bake for about 12 minutes, for rare, 16 minutes for medium, or 20 minutes for well done. For best results use a meat thermometer to determine the temperature of the steaks, with 140 degrees F (60 degrees C) being medium doneness. Remove from the oven and allow to rest for about 5 minutes.",
      "While the steaks are cooking, make the sauce. Melt the butter in a saucepan over medium heat. Stir in the flour and cook, stirring constantly, until browned. Stir in the green onions, and cook until tender, about 1 minute. Gradually stir in the reserved consomme and the remaining 1 cup of consomme; continue to cook and stir until the sauce thickens. Reduce heat to low and stir in the wine. Continue to simmer until thickened, about 15 minutes. Remove from the heat and stir in butter and parsley. Season with salt and pepper to taste.",
      "To serve, cut each Wellington in half and spoon some sauce onto the plate.",
