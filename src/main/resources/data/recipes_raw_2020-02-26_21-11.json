    "description": "\r\n\"Over the years, I've developed a first-rate, do-ahead menu. Here's how: I roast two small turkeys instead of one big one. We all like the idea of someone carving the turkey at the table, but here's the reality: Most people don't know how. You're gonna get turkey juices all over that nice white tablecloth, while the side dishes turn tepid. So carve one in the kitchen and use the second one for display. The second turkey is strictly for show, seconds and leftovers.\"        ",
    "ingredients": [
      "2 turkeys (10 to 12 pounds each), neck and giblets discarded",
      "3 cups kosher salt (do not use regular table salt)",
      "2 cups granulated sugar",
      "2 unpeeled medium onions, coarsely chopped",
      "2 unpeeled medium carrots, coarsely chopped",
      "2 stalks celery stalks, coarsely chopped",
      "2 tablespoons melted butter",
      "1 cup dry white wine or vermouth",
      "4 cups low-sodium chicken broth",
      "1/4 cup cornstarch"
    ],
    "instructions": [
      "The night before roasting, dissolve salt and sugar in 3 gallons of cold water in a large, clean ice chest or similar container in a cold spot, such as an unheated basement or garage. For those in warm climates, add ice packs to keep turkeys cool. Add turkeys, breast-side down; cover and let stand about 12 hours. (This brining keeps the turkey from drying out and seasons it right down to the bone.) Drain. Rinse turkeys and pat dry.",
      "About five hours before serving, set oven to 425 degrees and adjust oven rack to lower-middle position. Place turkey No. 1 breast-side down and cut out the back with kitchen shears. Open up turkey and turn it breast-side up, pressing on it with your palms so it lies flat. Place turkey, skin-side up, on a lipped cookie sheet over a bed of half the chopped vegetables. Brush turkey with butter.",
      "Roast until a meat thermometer inserted into the thigh registers 175 degrees, 1 to 1 1/2 hours. Watch vegetables and pan drippings throughout - they should be kept dry enough to brown and produce the rich brown goo with which to brush Turkey No. 2 and make a rich gravy, but moist enough to keep from burning. So add water as needed throughout the cooking.",
      "Remove pan from oven and transfer turkey to a cutting board; reserve vegetables and pan juices for Turkey No. 2. Let the bird rest 30 minutes to 1 hour before carving, to allow the meat to firm up. Carve, transferring slices to an ovenproof serving platter or baking pan. Cover with aluminum foil. Refrigerate or set in a cool spot (below 40 degrees) until mealtime. Gently rewarm, covered, on platter or baking pan.",
      "Immediately after removing the first turkey, lower the oven temperature to 400 degrees and adjust oven rack to lowest position. Scrape vegetables and pan drippings from Turkey No. 1 into a roasting pan. Set a V-rack in the pan. Place remaining raw vegetables in the cavity of Turkey No. 2, then tie legs together with kitchen string for a nicer presentation. Set turkey, breast-side down, on rack. Brush with pan drippings from Turkey No. 1.",
      "Roast 1 hour. Remove from oven; baste back and sides with pan drippings. Using two wads of paper towels, carefully turn breast-side up and baste. Keep roasting until a thermometer inserted into the leg registers 175 degrees, 1 to 1 1/2 hours longer. Again, watch vegetables and drippings throughout and add water as needed. Transfer turkey to a platter for display (and then for seconds and leftovers).",
      "For gravy: Set roasting pan over 2 burners on medium-high heat. Add wine and, using a wooden spoon, stir to loosen brown bits. Strain contents of pan through a large strainer into a saucepan. Add broth and bring to a boil. Whisk cornstarch with 1/2 cup water (or 1/2 cup flour with 1 cup water), then gradually whisk into pan juices. Bring to a boil, reduce heat to low and simmer until thickened. Serve immediately.",

      "2 teaspoons ground cinnamon"

    "instructions": [
      "Wash the goose thoroughly and pat dry with paper towels. Let the goose sit at room temperature for about 30 minutes. Meanwhile, mix together the allspice, 1/2 teaspoon cinnamon, salt and pepper in a small bowl and set aside to make a spice rub.",
      "Remove any lumps of visible fat from the cavity of the goose, and render the goose fat in a skillet over medium heat until the fat is liquid and the remaining bits are crisp and brown, about 15 minutes. Reserve 3 tablespoons of goose fat and save the rest for another use, or discard.",
      "Working in batches if necessary, fry the sliced apples in the reserved goose fat in a large skillet over medium heat until the apple slices are browned, about 10 minutes per batch. Remove the browned apple slices to a large mixing bowl, let cool slightly, and sprinkle with the Calvados and 2 teaspoons of cinnamon. Mix lightly to combine.",
      "With the point of a sharp knife, prick the entire skin of the goose, being careful not to cut into the meat. Rub the exterior of the goose well with the spice rub, massaging the spices into the skin.",
      "Preheat an oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).",
      "Spoon the apple stuffing lightly into the cavity of the goose, and lay it on a large sheet of aluminum foil big enough to wrap over the entire goose. Wrap the goose in the foil, seal the edges, and make a 1/2-inch hole in the bottom of the foil packet to allow the fat from the goose to drain. Place the bird breast side up, on a rack set into a large baking pan, and roast the goose in the preheated oven until no longer pink at the bone and the juices run clear, about an hour and a half. Peel the foil back from the breast meat and roast for another 45 minutes until the skin browns, basting once or twice to prevent burning. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest part of the thigh, near the bone should read 180 degrees F (82 degrees C).",
      "Remove the goose from the oven, cover with a doubled sheet of aluminum foil, and allow to rest in a warm area 10 to 15 minutes before serving.",

Add enough boiling water to cover the beans by one inch. Cover the top of the pot tightly with aluminum foil so that it goes down over the sides by at least 2 inches. Place lid onto bean pot.",

Place the bean pot into the hole, and put the coals from the hole back in around the sides and over the top of the bean pot. Now start filling the hole in with the dirt, packing it down with your feet as you go. You should end up with about 2 feet of dirt covering the pot.

When the oil and butter just begin to give off wisps of smoke, place the chicken into the skillet, skin side down and flat. The \"knees\" of the chicken legs should point towards each other so the legs are flat. Place a piece of aluminum foil on top of the chicken, and weight it down with the heavy skillet or Dutch oven to press the chicken down as it cooks.",
