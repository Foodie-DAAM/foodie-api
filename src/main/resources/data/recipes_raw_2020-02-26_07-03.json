You can use a food processor to 'mash' the livers, but the result is too refined for my taste, too much like a pate; traditional chopped liver is lumpy! If you're willing to do the mixing with your hands, you'll get the best results. NOTE: Under NO circumstances should you add beef or any other kind of liver or filler; this will spoil the flavor. Enjoy! ",

In a separate bowl, mash the eggs and add to the liver. Add the grated or finely chopped raw onion and chopped green onions and mix all together. The liver mixture should still be warm, and will slightly cook the onions. Season mixture with salt and pepper to taste and add at least 1 tablespoon paprika (more if desired, or if you're Hungarian!). Add 1 tablespoon chopped parsley. Mix well with a large spoon and refrigerate for 1 to 2 hours.",
